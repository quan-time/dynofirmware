This is an actual data sample taken from a real bike on the dyno.
Note values are in HEX, and start large and get smaller and smaller.
The last value is always 0 because its just a place holder currently.

Because the drum is spooling up, and its spinning slowly, the teeth
take longer to pass the sensor, thus its a BIG number.  The number is
microsec's of tooth state.
Towards the end when when the drum is spinning fast, the numbers are
much shorter.
When the drum starts slowing down again, because of the end of the run,
the softawre tells the dyno to STOP dumping out data, with the "T" at
the bottom.
