The original firmware was written in PBasic and im attempting to 
translate it to Arduino (basically its C#) to be utilized on the 
Teensy++ 2.0 board.

Its by no means perfect, but should work.  Full pinouts, schematics
and pics will come at a later date when required.

Ill see if i can include the whole WOTID front end later on.  Its
not my software and theres no "freeware / OS" implication.  Wait
and see i guess..
